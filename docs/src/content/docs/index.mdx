# Standardize Your Tracking Events with TypeSpec

Stop the chaos of inconsistent and hard-to-maintain tracking event definitions. The `typespec-events` project provides a robust solution using TypeSpec as a single source of truth.

## The Problem

Managing tracking events across different teams and technologies often leads to:

- Data inconsistencies
- Missed tracking opportunities
- High maintenance burden

## The Solution

Define your tracking events once in TypeSpec. Our custom emitter generates type-safe code for your frontend and backend, ensuring consistency and reducing manual work.

```tsp
@event("product_viewed")
model ProductViewedEvent {
  productId: string;
  productName: string;
  category?: string;
}
```

This TypeSpec definition can generate code like Zod schemas for TypeScript:

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';

export const ProductViewedEventSchema = z.object({
  productId: z.string(),
  productName: z.string(),
  category: z.string().optional(),
});

export const eventSchemas = {
  product_viewed: ProductViewedEventSchema,
  // ... other events
};
```

And runtime utilities to use these schemas:

```ts
import { defineTracker } from '@typespec-events/runtime';
import { eventSchemas } from './events.zod'; // Generated file

const track = defineTracker({
  track: (eventName, properties) => {
    // Your actual tracking library call here (e.g., analytics.track)
    console.log(`Tracking event: ${eventName}`, properties);
  },
  events: eventSchemas,
});

// Example usage:
track('product_viewed', { productId: '123', productName: 'Awesome Gadget' });
```
