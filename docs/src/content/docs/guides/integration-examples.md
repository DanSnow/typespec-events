# Integration Examples

This section will provide examples of how to integrate the generated code and the `@typespec-events/runtime` package with popular tracking libraries (e.g., Segment, Google Analytics, Mixpanel).

*(Content coming soon. If you have a specific integration you'd like to see documented, please let us know!)*
