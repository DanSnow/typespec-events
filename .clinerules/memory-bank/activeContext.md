# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Refining the `@event` decorator in the TypeSpec helper library (`packages/lib`).

## Recent Changes

- Initial memory bank files created based on provided planning document content.
- Updated the `@event` decorator definition in `packages/lib/lib/decorators.tsp` to accept a required string literal `name` parameter.
- Updated the `event` function implementation in `packages/lib/src/decorators.ts` to correctly extract the string value from the string literal argument and store it using the `isEvent` state key.
- Renamed the previous `isEvent` accessor function to `getEventName` in `packages/lib/src/decorators.ts` to return the stored event name string (`string | undefined`).
- Created a new boolean `isEvent` function in `packages/lib/src/decorators.ts` to check for the presence of the `@event` decorator.
- Updated `packages/lib/test/decorators.test.ts` to use `getEventName` and test both the `getEventName` and the new boolean `isEvent` functions.

## Next Steps

- Update the emitter (`packages/emitter`) to generate Zod schemas for models marked with the `@event` decorator, using the stored event name retrieved via `getEventName`.
- Address the TypeSpec compiler API usage and import errors encountered during the initial attempt to implement Zod schema generation in `packages/emitter/src/emitter.ts`.
- Continue developing the custom emitter (`packages/emitter`) to generate code for Go and Rust structs.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The `alternateName` example decorator and its implementation have been removed as requested.
- The `@event` decorator now requires a string name parameter and stores this name using the existing `isEvent` state key.
- The accessor logic has been split into `isEvent` (boolean) and `getEventName` (string | undefined) for clarity.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Successfully navigating TypeSpec decorator implementation involves coordinating changes between `.tsp` definition files and corresponding TypeScript implementation files.
- Build processes in the monorepo require updating references in related files (like `index.ts` and test files) when code is removed or changed.
- Implementing emitter logic requires careful attention to TypeSpec compiler API details and correct import paths.
- Correctly handling TypeSpec literal types (like `StringLiteral`) is crucial when accessing decorator arguments in the implementation.
- Adhering to naming conventions (e.g., `is` prefix for boolean functions) improves code clarity.
- The project is progressing according to the plan outlined in `progress.md`.
