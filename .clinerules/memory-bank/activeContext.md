# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Implementing the TypeSpec helper library (`packages/lib`), starting with the `@event` decorator.

## Recent Changes

- Initial memory bank files created based on provided planning document content.
- Implemented the `@event` decorator definition in `packages/lib/lib/decorators.tsp`.
- Implemented the `$event` decorator logic and `isEvent` accessor in `packages/lib/src/decorators.ts`.
- Added `isEvent` to `StateKeys` in `packages/lib/src/lib.ts`.
- Updated `packages/lib/src/index.ts` to export `isEvent` and remove `getAlternateName`.
- Updated `packages/lib/test/decorators.test.ts` with tests for `@event` and removed `alternateName` tests and unused imports.
- Successfully built the `packages/lib` project after resolving build errors related to removed code and imports.

## Next Steps

- Present the completed `@event` decorator implementation and successful build to the user.
- Continue developing the TypeSpec helper library (`packages/lib`) by implementing remaining decorators and helper functions, or begin planning the custom emitter (`packages/emitter`).

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The `alternateName` example decorator and its implementation have been removed as requested.
- The `@event` decorator is currently a simple marker; future iterations may involve adding parameters for event metadata.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Successfully navigating TypeSpec decorator implementation involves coordinating changes between `.tsp` definition files and corresponding TypeScript implementation files.
- Build processes in the monorepo require updating references in related files (like `index.ts` and test files) when code is removed or changed.
- The project is progressing according to the plan outlined in `progress.md`.
