# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Initializing the memory bank based on the provided document content.

## Recent Changes

- Created `projectbrief.md` with the project's core goals.
- Created `productContext.md` detailing the problems solved and how the project addresses them.
- Created `systemPatterns.md` outlining the monorepo structure and key components.
- Created `techContext.md` listing the technologies used and development setup.

## Next Steps

- Create `progress.md` to track project status, completed work, remaining tasks, and known issues.
- Review all created memory bank files to ensure they accurately reflect the provided document content and the project structure.
- Present the initialized memory bank to the user and ask if they are satisfied or require any adjustments.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The provided document content has been used as the primary source for initializing the memory bank files.
- The project structure (monorepo with `packages/lib` and `packages/emitter`) has been incorporated into the `systemPatterns.md` file.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project aims to solve inconsistencies and maintenance issues in tracking events through a centralized TypeSpec definition and code generation.
- The main challenges identified are the TypeSpec learning curve and the cost of emitter development.
