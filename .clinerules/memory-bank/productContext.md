# Product Context

This project exists to address the challenges of managing tracking events across diverse teams and technologies.

## Problems Solved

- **Inconsistent Event Definitions**: Different teams often define the same event differently, leading to data confusion.
- **Missing Events**: Lack of a unified standard can result in important tracking events being overlooked.
- **Maintenance Difficulty**: Modifying events requires changes in multiple places, increasing maintenance overhead.

## How it Should Work

The project aims to provide a single source of truth for tracking event definitions using TypeSpec. This allows for clear, consistent definitions with associated metadata. Custom emitters will generate code for various platforms (frontend, backend) and languages (Zod/TypeScript, Go, Rust), ensuring consistency and reducing manual work. This approach facilitates team collaboration around a shared definition.

## Simple Solution (Context)

A simple approach using frontend schema definition tools like Zod directly in code addresses frontend-only tracking but is insufficient for events requiring backend tracking.

## TypeSpec Solution (Proposed)

Using TypeSpec offers:
- **Clear Event Definition**: Powerful expression for structure, metadata, and environment-specific behavior.
- **Frontend/Backend Code Generation**: Custom emitters reduce duplication and ensure consistency.
- **Team Collaboration**: A single TypeSpec file serves as a shared understanding.

## Challenges

- **Learning Curve**: TypeSpec requires time to learn its syntax and tools.
- **Emitter Development Cost**: Building custom emitters requires dedicated effort.
