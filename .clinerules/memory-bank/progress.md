# Progress

## What Works

- Initial memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created based on the provided planning document content.
- The core concept of using TypeSpec for standardized tracking event definitions and code generation is established.
- The monorepo structure with `packages/lib` and `packages/emitter` is understood.

## What's Left to Build

- The actual TypeSpec definitions for tracking events in `packages/lib`.
- The custom emitter logic in `packages/emitter` to generate code for TypeScript/Zod, Go, and Rust.
- Integration of the generated code into example frontend and backend applications.
- Comprehensive testing for both the TypeSpec definitions and the emitter.

## Current Status

The memory bank initialization is in progress. The foundational context files have been created. The next step is to review these files and confirm they accurately capture the project's initial state and goals.

## Known Issues

- The exact path to the original Obsidian document was difficult to determine, requiring manual content pasting. This highlights a potential need for clearer documentation location or access methods in the future.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The decision to use TypeSpec over a simpler frontend-only solution like Zod was made to support both frontend and backend tracking requirements and ensure consistency across platforms.
- The monorepo structure was chosen to simplify development and management of the TypeSpec library and its custom emitter.
