# Progress

## What Works

- Initial memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created based on the provided planning document content.
- The core concept of using TypeSpec for standardized tracking event definitions and code generation is established.
- The monorepo structure with `packages/lib` and `packages/emitter` is understood.

## What's Left to Build

Here is a detailed breakdown of the remaining tasks, incorporating feedback on the role of `packages/lib`:

1.  **Develop TypeSpec Helper Library (`packages/lib`)**:
    *   Implement TypeSpec decorators and helper functions (e.g., `@event`) within `packages/lib` to facilitate defining tracking events.
    *   Ensure the library provides the necessary tools for users to define their events consistently.

2.  **Develop Custom Emitter Logic (`packages/emitter`)**:
    *   Implement the emitter logic to read TypeSpec definitions (which will be defined by users consuming the `packages/lib` helper).
    *   Generate code for TypeScript/Zod schemas based on the TypeSpec definitions.
    *   Generate code for Go structs based on the TypeSpec definitions.
    *   Generate code for Rust structs based on the TypeSpec definitions.
    *   Ensure the generated code is idiomatic and correct for each target language/framework.

3.  **Create Example Usage and Integration**:
    *   Create a simple example project that demonstrates how to use the `packages/lib` helper library to define tracking events in TypeSpec.
    *   Showcase how the `packages/emitter` is used to generate code from these definitions.
    *   Integrate the generated code into simple example frontend and backend application snippets to demonstrate consumption.

4.  **Implement Comprehensive Testing**:
    *   Write unit tests for the `packages/lib` helper library to ensure decorators and functions work as expected.
    *   Write tests for the custom emitter (`packages/emitter`) to verify that it correctly processes TypeSpec definitions and generates accurate code for all target languages.
    *   Implement integration tests to ensure the generated code works correctly within example usage scenarios.

## Current Status

The memory bank initialization is complete. We are now in the planning phase, refining the breakdown of remaining tasks based on the intended roles of the `lib` and `emitter` packages.

## Known Issues

- The exact path to the original Obsidian document was difficult to determine, requiring manual content pasting. This highlights a potential need for clearer documentation location or access methods in the future.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The decision to use TypeSpec over a simpler frontend-only solution like Zod was made to support both frontend and backend tracking requirements and ensure consistency across platforms.
- The monorepo structure was chosen to simplify development and management of the TypeSpec library and its custom emitter.
- Clarified that `packages/lib` will be a helper library providing decorators and utilities, while the actual event definitions will reside in user projects that depend on this library.
