# Progress

## What Works

- Initial memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created based on the provided planning document content.
- The core concept of using TypeSpec for standardized tracking event definitions and code generation is established.
- The monorepo structure with `packages/lib` and `packages/emitter` is understood.
- The `@event` decorator in `packages/lib` has been updated to accept a required string literal `name` parameter.
- The implementation of the `@event` decorator in `packages/lib/src/decorators.ts` now correctly extracts and stores the string value of the event name using the `isEvent` state key.
- The accessor logic for the `@event` decorator in `packages/lib/src/decorators.ts` has been split into `getEventName` (returns `string | undefined`) and `isEvent` (returns `boolean`).
- The tests in `packages/lib/test/decorators.test.ts` have been updated to verify the functionality of both `getEventName` and the new boolean `isEvent` functions. The `packages/lib` project builds successfully.
- The emitter and lib logic have been merged into a single package located at `packages/lib`.
- The package in `packages/lib/package.json` has been renamed from `@typespec-events/lib` to `@typespec-events/typespec`.

## What's Left to Build

Here is a detailed breakdown of the remaining tasks, incorporating feedback on the role of `packages/lib` and the merged package:

1.  **Develop TypeSpec Helper Library (`packages/typespec`)**:
    *   Implement remaining TypeSpec decorators and helper functions within the merged package (`packages/lib`, now logically `packages/typespec`) to facilitate defining tracking events.
    *   Ensure the library provides the necessary tools for users to define their events consistently.

2.  **Develop Custom Emitter Logic (`packages/typespec`)**:
    *   Implement the emitter logic within the merged package (`packages/lib`, now logically `packages/typespec`) to read TypeSpec definitions (which will be defined by users consuming the helper).
    *   Generate code for TypeScript/Zod schemas based on the TypeSpec definitions, utilizing the event name stored by the `@event` decorator.
    *   Generate code for Go structs based on the TypeSpec definitions.
    *   Generate code for Rust structs based on the TypeSpec definitions.
    *   Ensure the generated code is idiomatic and correct for each target language/framework.

3.  **Create Example Usage and Integration**:
    *   Create a simple example project that demonstrates how to use the `@typespec-events/typespec` package to define tracking events in TypeSpec.
    *   Showcase how the emitter within `@typespec-events/typespec` is used to generate code from these definitions.
    *   Integrate the generated code into simple example frontend and backend application snippets to demonstrate consumption.

4.  **Implement Comprehensive Testing**:
    *   Write unit tests for the helper library aspects of `@typespec-events/typespec` to ensure decorators and functions work as expected.
    *   Write tests for the emitter aspects of `@typespec-events/typespec` to verify that it correctly processes TypeSpec definitions and generates accurate code for all target languages.
    *   Implement integration tests to ensure the generated code works correctly within example usage scenarios.

5.  **Create Runtime Package (`@typespec-events/runtime`)**:
    *   Create a new package `packages/runtime` for utility functions related to sending tracking events.

6.  **Potentially Create Zod Helper Package**:
    *   Create a separate package if needed for Zod integration helpers.

## Current Status

The `@event` decorator in the merged package (`packages/lib`, now logically `@typespec-events/typespec`) has been successfully updated and tested, including the split accessor functions (`getEventName` and `isEvent`). The package name in `package.json` has been updated. The next major step is to implement the Zod schema generation logic within the `@typespec-events/typespec` package.

## Known Issues

- The exact path to the original Obsidian document was difficult to determine, requiring manual content pasting. This highlights a potential need for clearer documentation location or access methods in the future.
- Encountered TypeSpec compiler API usage and import errors during the initial attempt to implement Zod schema generation in `packages/lib/src/emitter.ts`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The decision to use TypeSpec over a simpler frontend-only solution like Zod was made to support both frontend and backend tracking requirements and ensure consistency across platforms.
- The monorepo structure was chosen to simplify development and management of the TypeSpec library and its custom emitter.
- Clarified that the merged package (`@typespec-events/typespec`) will contain both the helper library and the emitter logic.
- The accessor logic for the `@event` decorator was split into `isEvent` (boolean) and `getEventName` (string | undefined) for improved clarity and adherence to naming conventions.
- Decided to rename the merged package to `@typespec-events/typespec` and plan for separate `@typespec-events/runtime` and potential Zod helper packages.
