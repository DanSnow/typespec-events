# Progress

## What Works

- Initial memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created based on the provided planning document content.
- The core concept of using TypeSpec for standardized tracking event definitions and code generation is established.
- The monorepo structure with `packages/lib` and `packages/emitter` is understood.
- The `@event` decorator in `packages/lib` has been updated to accept a required string literal `name` parameter.
- The implementation of the `@event` decorator in `packages/lib/src/decorators.ts` now correctly extracts and stores the string value of the event name using the `isEvent` state key.
- The accessor logic for the `@event` decorator in `packages/lib/src/decorators.ts` has been split into `getEventName` (returns `string | undefined`) and `isEvent` (returns `boolean`).
- The tests in `packages/lib/test/decorators.test.ts` have been updated to verify the functionality of both `getEventName` and the new boolean `isEvent` functions. The `packages/lib` project builds successfully.
- The emitter and lib logic have been merged into a single package located at `packages/lib`.
- The package in `packages/lib/package.json` has been renamed from `@typespec-events/lib` to `@typespec-events/typespec`.
- The `typeSpecTypeToZodString` function in `packages/typespec/src/emitter.ts` has been refactored for better maintainability and exported for improved testability. Comprehensive test cases have been added in `packages/typespec/test/emitter.test.ts` covering various TypeSpec types, and the failing scalar types test was fixed by removing the non-standard `uuid` type. All tests related to `typeSpecTypeToZodString` are now passing.
- The `playground` package serves as an example of library usage and a location for integration tests that verify emitter output.
- Integration tests in the playground verify the content of generated files after compilation, rather than programmatically compiling within the test.

## What's Left to Build

Here is a detailed breakdown of the remaining tasks, incorporating feedback on the role of `packages/lib` and the merged package, and the plan for the runtime and emitter:

1.  **Develop the `@typespec-events/runtime` package:**
    *   Create a new package directory `packages/runtime`.
    *   Add a `package.json` file with necessary dependencies (e.g., Zod).
    *   Implement the `defineTracker` function in `packages/runtime/src/index.ts`. This function will accept an object with:
        *   `track`: The user-provided function to send the event (e.g., `analytics.track`).
        *   `validation`: An optional boolean to enable/disable runtime validation (defaulting to `true`).
        *   `events`: An object mapping event names (strings) to their corresponding Zod schemas.
    *   The `defineTracker` function will return a type-safe `track` function. This returned function will take the event name and properties, look up the corresponding schema in the `events` object, perform runtime validation using Zod if `validation` is enabled, and then call the user-provided `track` function with the validated data.
    *   Add unit tests for the `defineTracker` and the returned `track` function, covering cases with and without validation, correct and incorrect event properties.

2.  **Enhance the Emitter in `@typespec-events/typespec`:**
    *   The emitter currently generates the Zod schema files (e.g., `events.zod.ts`). It needs to also generate the mapping of event names to these schemas.
    *   Modify the emitter logic in `packages/typespec/src/emitter.ts` to iterate through the TypeSpec models decorated with `@event`.
    *   For each `@event` decorated model, retrieve the event name using `getEventName` and the generated Zod schema identifier.
    *   Generate a TypeScript file (e.g., `events.map.ts` or similar) that exports an object containing this mapping (e.g., `{ product_viewed: ProductViewedSchema, user_signed_up: UserSignedUpSchema }`).
    *   Consider generating a basic `track.ts` file template that imports the necessary components from `@typespec-events/runtime` and the generated schema map, allowing users to easily fill in their specific tracking implementation.

3.  **Update Playground Integration:**
    *   Update the `packages/playground/main.tsp` to include models decorated with `@event`.
    *   Configure the playground's `tspconfig.yaml` to use the `@typespec-events/typespec` emitter.
    *   Update the integration test in `packages/playground/test/integration.test.ts` to verify the generation of both the Zod schema file and the new event map file.
    *   Add a test case in the integration test to demonstrate using the generated files with the `@typespec-events/runtime` package.

4.  **Continue developing the custom emitter for Go and Rust structs.**

5.  **Potentially create a helper package for Zod integration if needed.**

## Current Status

The `@event` decorator in the merged package (`packages/lib`, now logically `@typespec-events/typespec`) has been successfully updated and tested, including the split accessor functions (`getEventName` and `isEvent`). The package name in `package.json` has been updated. The `typeSpecTypeToZodString` function has been refactored and tested. The `activeContext.md` memory bank file has been successfully updated.

The plan for developing the `@typespec-events/runtime` package and enhancing the `@typespec-events/typespec` emitter based on the `track.ts` consumption pattern has been outlined and documented.

## Known Issues

- The exact path to the original Obsidian document was difficult to determine, requiring manual content pasting. This highlights a potential need for clearer documentation location or access methods in the future.
- Encountered TypeSpec compiler API usage and import errors during the initial attempt to implement Zod schema generation in `packages/lib/src/emitter.ts`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The decision to use TypeSpec over a simpler frontend-only solution like Zod was made to support both frontend and backend tracking requirements and ensure consistency across platforms.
- The monorepo structure was chosen to simplify development and management of the TypeSpec library and its custom emitter.
- Clarified that the merged package (`@typespec-events/typespec`) will contain both the helper library and the emitter logic.
- The accessor logic for the `@event` decorator was split into `isEvent` (boolean) and `getEventName` (string | undefined) for improved clarity and adherence to naming conventions.
- Decided to rename the merged package to `@typespec-events/typespec` and plan for separate `@typespec-events/runtime` and potential Zod helper packages.
- The plan for the `@typespec-events/runtime` package and emitter enhancements was developed based on the desired user consumption pattern shown in the provided `track.ts` file.
